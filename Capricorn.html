<h1 style="text-align:center;"> So you belong with Capricorn. The ambitious and materialistic Zodiac sign... How fitting of you... </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> A Capricorn.. I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean...
</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Capricorns aren’t consumed by the need for attention, but are not immune to it. They simply don’t indulge in attention-seeking behavior. They don’t want attention for their looks or style or ingenuity. They don’t want to be admired, but they do want to be respected. They don’t want to be the center of attention. Instead it’s like they need to prove their own abilities to themselves.

Capricorns are constantly competing with themselves. They do want praise, though. Not adulation, just praise. Praise is a simple acknowledgment of a job well done. Praise is a pat on the back. They use this as validation to compensate for general feelings of incompetence and inferiority. They plow through adversity with blinders on until they reach success.

<p> So... this is where I belong... I like it.
