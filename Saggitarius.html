<h1 style="text-align:center;"> So you belong with Saggitarius. The loyal and smart Zodiac sign... How fitting of you... </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> A Saggitarius.. I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean...
</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Sagittarius is the ultimate empiricist. They will always choose principles over feelings and will often question who they are. They move from job to job, philosophy to philosophy, belief to belief. They are explorers of the human condition and are unafraid of change. Sagittarians feel like the world is their playground. They love to explore the unknown. They want to understand how the world works.

On an unbounded quest to discover the whole of the universe inside of themselves, Sagittarians are unshackled from any particular worldly attachment. They are reckless in their pursuit of what they want, and often end up doing and experiencing things that defy conceptions of the possible.

Sagittarius is an explorer. They are both the fearless adventurer and the jaded critic. They understand that knowledge comes in two forms: the shallow, disposable kind that comes from external sources, and the kind that comes from within. Sagittarius knows that external knowledge can be easily gained while internal knowledge is exponentially deeper and more powerful. They’re on a quest to delve into the depths of the universe inside the human mind. They don’t do this to prove that they have all the answers, but instead because they know that the journey is the destination.

<p> So... this is where I belong... I like it.
