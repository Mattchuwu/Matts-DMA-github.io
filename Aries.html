<h1 style="text-align:center;"> So you belong with Aries. The youngest of the Zodiacs... How fitting of you... </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> An Aries... I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean...
</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">At their core, Aries do what they want and do things their way. They are unafraid of conflict, highly competitive, honest and direct. An Aries is not weighed down by the freedom of choice, and is perhaps the sign that is least conflicted about what they want. They throw themselves at the world eagerly and without fear. It is one of their most commendable qualities, but also what causes them a great deal of pain and grief.

Aries are driven by a desire to prove themselves and their strength. They naturally take charge and are competitive and ambitious. Aries are spontaneous and courageous. They have a sense of adventure and love to explore. They’re determined and bold, and are good at initiating new projects. They have high energy and can initiate quick actions. They can also be impatient, but are naturally active and don’t like to waste time.

While Aries like competition, they don’t like to play games. They are highly self-aware, have strong opinions and are always ready to defend them.

<p> So... this is where I belong... I like it.
