<h1 style="text-align:center;"> So you belong with Libra. The empathetic and compassionate Zodiac sign... How fitting of you... </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> A Libra... I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean...
</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Libras are difficult to really understand because they seem so contradictory on the surface. They’re simultaneously extroverted and introverted, strategic and spontaneous, focused and intuitive. This variability makes it difficult to pin down their true character. They are an entire constellation of personalities. Libras are different depending on who they're around.

This is because Libras value empathy. They are receptive. They can be other people’s mirrors. Because of this, they have strong opinions about other people, but take a long time to understand themselves.

They want to be admired not for their talents but for their charm. They want to be seen as the responsible figure who can balance out the turbulent elements around them. They feel an intense amount of guilt and shame when they are unhappy because they know that their unhappiness affects everyone around them.

<p> So... this is where I belong... I like it.
