<h1 style="text-align:center;"> So you belong with Gemini. The flexible and clever Zodiac sign... How fitting of you... </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> A Gemini.. I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean...
</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Geminis are very intelligent and pick up knowledge quickly. They are perceptive, analytical, and often very funny. They have an unreserved and childlike curiosity, always asking new questions.

Geminis have an uncanny ability to size up a person’s character in a matter of seconds, even if they only just met them. If someone’s bluffing, they’ll be the first to notice. They are great communicators, very responsive and sensitive listeners.

Geminis are versatile, comfortable being both introverts and extroverts. They are quick to adapt to the energy of a room. They can be the life of the party or a complete wallflower. They know how to bring dissimilar people together and make them get along.

<p> So... this is where I belong... I like it.
