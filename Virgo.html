<h1 style="text-align:center;"> So you belong with Virgo. The practical and observant Zodiac sign... How fitting of you... </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> A Virgo.. I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean...
</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Virgos are known for being perfectionists. Clean freaks. They are known for their attention to detail. They can find patterns where there are none. They can be finicky and critical to a fault.

It’s true that Virgos are very particular, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they keep neat spaces. Their particularities and habits don’t necessarily line up with traditional views of cleanliness. They could live in what looks like a Tasmanian devil-style dust storm ruin, but still impose a “no shoes in the house” or “no outside clothes on the bed” rule. Maybe their house looks cluttered, but they still know where everything is. Everything has its place. Virgos prefer to exist in organized spaces, but put their service orientation over their own comfort. This can mean that a Virgo is too busy fixing the lives of those around them to put much work into providing for their own needs. They’re rarely motivated by their own self-interest.

Virgos are also known for being intelligent, but because of their introverted nature they can sometimes have trouble expressing themselves. Talking to them may feel like floating on the surface of existence, and like you never know what they’re thinking and feeling deep inside. Their emphasis on thoughts and ideas can seem like a cover-up for their lack of emotional depth. In reality, they are a fortress unto themselves—the definition of self-containment. Virgos will be endlessly accepting of whatever you have to share, but may not see the value in spontaneously performing a similar excavation of themselves for anyone else.
