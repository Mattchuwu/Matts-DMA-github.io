<h1 style="text-align:center;"> So you belong with Cancer. The intuitive and moody Zodiac sign... How fitting of you... </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> A Cancer.. I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean...
</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Cancers are often stubborn, but they do not have to be. Cancers are often criticized for being harsh on those who they feel have wronged them. They can be punishing, vengeful, and slow to forgive. They hold on to past hurts, but that doesn’t mean they wield them. They’re often too self-effacing to bring them up except when they finally erupt. It would be easier if they could just forgive and forget. They want their wounds to be healed, so they bury them. They’re wounded by their own attachment to memory. It is important for them to remember that transformation is not only possible, but is the natural order of life.

<p> So... this is where I belong... I like it.
